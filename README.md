This project was submitted as my undergraduate computer science capstone project. Red Bike Adventures is a fictional company created by me for the purposes of this project.

The dataset that was used is the public dataset from the University of
California Irvineâ€™s Machine Learning Repository which consists of a two-year historical log
corresponding to the years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C. The description of this dataset was changed to fit the narrative that was made up for
this project. The public dataset can be found below:

Use of this dataset in publications is required to be cited to the following publication:
