This project was submitted as my undergraduate computer science capstone project. Red Bike Adventures is a fictional company created by me for the purposes of this project. To visit the website created here, please go to: https://beth-culler.vercel.app/

The goal of this project is to solve the following business need:

"The Little Red Rock Trail is one of the most visited biking trails in Nevada, with roughly one million
visitors each year, due to its fun ride and amazing views of the valley in Red Rock Canyon. Most visitors
are able to enjoy cycling the Little Red Rock Trail by renting a bike from the Red Bike Adventures bike station 
located at the trailhead. Due to its popularity, many non-local visitors would like to try to plan their trip to 
the area during a time they can be more guaranteed a bike to rent, so many call inquiring about what times those 
may be. Due to the many factors that contribute to bike availability (temperature, time of year, local events, etc.), 
it is very difficult to provide customers with a reliable answer. Currently customers can only drive out to the rural 
area and hope a bike is still available to rent. This uncertainty may deter customers from visiting.
Red Bike Adventures is a tourism-dependent company and thus needs to encourage as many visitors as possible.

In resolving this, the solution will provide customers with useful information regarding historical trends
and future predictions of bike availability to reduce uncertainty and therefore encourage tourism to
continue to thrive. This will ensure that Red Bike Adventures remains the number one provider of bike
sharing systems in Nevada."


The dataset that was used is the public dataset from the University of
California Irvineâ€™s Machine Learning Repository which consists of a two-year historical log
corresponding to the years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C. The description of this dataset was changed to fit the narrative that was made up for
this project. The public dataset can be found below:
